# The Basic Structure
To set up the structure of our JavaScript quiz, we’ll need to start with the following HTML:
![img_3.png](img_3.png)

Next, we need to add a div element with class
slide to hold the question and answer on the main.js:

![img_4.png](img_4.png)



Next, we can use some CSS positioning to make the slides sit as layers on top of one another.
In this example, you’ll notice we’re using z-indexes and opacity transitions to allow our slides to fade in and out.
Here’s what that CSS might look like:
![img_5.png](img_5.png)
